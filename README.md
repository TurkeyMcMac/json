This is my JSON parser. I want some practice making parsers, and JSON seemed
relatively easy and useful.

## Tests
I got the tests from [this repository](https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite),
which can be found under the `tests` directory here, or the `test_parsing`
directory in the original project. Many thanks to Nicolas Seriot for providing
those tests publicly.
